About Me
======
Iâ€™m a second-year PhD student in Computer Science at Osaka University, affiliated with [ISLAB](https://www.is.ids.osaka-u.ac.jp/en/) and [D3 Center](https://www.d3c.osaka-u.ac.jp/en/). I am fortunate to be advised by [Yuta Nakashima](https://www.n-yuta.jp/). My current research interests broadly lie in computer vision, and large language models.
